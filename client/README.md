### News search engine

This project was created using React and a proxy server in Express to effectively reach an API and obtain news from different news outlets. When going through this code, bear in mind that I know nothing about backend development. Simple as it may seem, I had to read A LOT to be able to build this. And, all things considered, I think it's a pretty decent first try. I can only go up from here!
Feel free to edit and comment on it. It'd be very welcomed. Just download all the files and run the following commands in the project directory: npm install npm start
